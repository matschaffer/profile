My Bash Profile
===============

This is the profile that I'm now using across a number of machines that I administer.  Most of the tricks I use are fairly general and could be reused by anyone.

What's it look like?
--------------------

Installation
------------

    curl -s https://raw.github.com/matschaffer/profile/master/install | bash

From here you can now put any `*.conf` in `~/.profile.d` and it'll get loaded in alphabetical order. You can also make directories that end in `.conf` which profile will then load all the `.conf` files in that directory in order.

Additionally, if you need to have OS-specific configuration just put a folder in `.profile.d` or `.profile.d/core` with the name returned by `uname`, for example `.profile.d/Darwin`. The profile checks `uname` when bash starts and loads any `.conf` files or directories in this OS-specific folder.

Load order
----------

This profile loads `init` first, followed by all the `.conf` files in `.profile.d/core`, then any `.conf` files in `.profile.d`. This way you can put any general use configs in `core` and anything personal in `.profile.d`. If you want to keep your personal profile information in git, just set up `core` as a submodule to your personal repository.

Contributing
------------

As noted in the LICENSE file. This is all MIT licensed code, so do what you will. But to make things easy for contributions please keep all stuff in core as generic as possible so others can merge it into their own forks. If you need any personal stuff (e.g., API Keys), keep that in a separate git repository that loads this repo as a submodule.
